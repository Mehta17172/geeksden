*Nowadays there is a trend of startups everywhere,so people doing startups dont have sufficient facilities and resources.
*So we have created a web page portal to create a interface between the owner of the startups and people who wants jobs.
*Also people generally do not find job of there respective types and find it difficult to get jobs,hence we have developed a portal to career counselling and information about the jobs.
*We have created a login page to insert the users and add up there profile and job professions they like to do so that startups owner can find them easily and choose the person they need according to there need of work they can provide to their startup.
*Also if someone is facing a problem of getting jobs he can get proper career conselling and information about the jobs he can get according to his qualification and previous job records.
*Hence through our webpage portal the problem of lack of jobs will be eliminated upto a certain limit and people going for startup will find it very easy to have proper facilities and resources for their startups.
